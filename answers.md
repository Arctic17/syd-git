# Answers of Louis Rowlings Arctic17

## Basics
### Task 1
To start the the the file is unchanged meaning that there have been no modification to the file since the last pull. 
Once the file is saved with the modification its statuse changes to "unstaged". This indecates that the file is modified but has yet to be placed on the next commit. An analogy for this would be that the letter has been writen but has yet to be given to the post office hence it will not go on the next train out.

### Task 2
1. The exaple commit message can be broken down "CHG: " defining what the commit is doing in this case changing of data. then comes what was changed "personal data" in this case. Finaly where the changes would take place in this case that would be "answer.md".
2. No in the case of this Lab it is not possible to commit without a message as messages are the best way to keep track of changes and modification on a project. However it is possible to disable this lock on cetrain Repos using a command unknown to me.
3. The commit changes my local repository with the updated changes to the files i have just commited. how ever this does not affect the online/remote repos untile a git puch is executed 
4. No as stated in the previeus answnser the online repo has not changed unitl a git push.


### Task 3
I can see that ther are 2 typs of files waiting to be staged the first being the "answers.md" the second being the new **Untracked** "README.md". The README file is untracked as it has just been created. The untracked means that the file has yet to be part of a commit and start having its modification tracked by git
