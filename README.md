# My README.md
the goal of this document is to :
* Approach the markdown syntax
* Show the results on a Git hub repository
### How-To
1. Identify constructs from given results
2. Write a corresponding Markdown syntax 

### Git - a command example

Git can be ran through command lines and the current status shown with: 


```bash
# Going inside directory
cd /my/git/dir
# Asking for current status
git status
git log --online
```
It is also important to note that
>"It is easy to shoot your foot off with git, but also easy to revert to a previous foot and merge it with your current leg."

-- Jack William Bell
